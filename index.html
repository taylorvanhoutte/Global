    <p class="center"><i>Hey, y'all!</i><br><br>
        I want to take a bit of time to update you on my life. I just completed my first semester of college at Illinois State University working towards my bachelor's in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Education along with a minor in Learning Behavioral Sciences. I have truly loved everything about ISU.<br><br>I have been participating in RSLA (a sign language club), and Salt Company (an on-campus ministry). I choose to spend my free time with friends or in my Bible, strengthening my relationship with Jesus and I'm so proud to say that I recently have been baptized. I have loved this first semester and can't imagine my life at any other school.</p>

    <h2 class="center fiveHun">WHY I'M GOING OVERSEARS?</h2>
    <p class="center">Seeing all the beautiful ways God has influenced my life this semester, I can't wait to see all that He can do for me in the future. More importantly, I can't wait to see what He does with those around me.<br><br>My local church here at ISU believes that college students have the power to change the world. This summer, me and a team of four other students from Salt Company will be sent to a college campus in Central Africa to share the word of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Bible calls us to not just evangelize to those around us but to go to the ends of the earth. I have been blessed with the opportunity to obey His word in such a special and life-altering way. This time will be spent depending on my relationship with Christ and helping others do the same.</p>
